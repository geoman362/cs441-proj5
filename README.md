This is a project by Garrett van der Linden , Nate Hilscher, and Gueorgui Milouchev
The goal is to create a gridded inventory application intended for use with Dungeons
Dragons Fifth Edition.

The app simulates an inventory that makes a player think about where their items are
rather than simply how much raw weight they can carry.
